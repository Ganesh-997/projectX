why we do subnetting 
subnets are a logical partition of an IP network into multiple, smaller network segments.
- To minimize traffic,
- More Secure 
- Improving network security

7. peering connection 
     peering connection allows you to route traffic between two Virtual Private Cloudâ€™s using IPv4 or IPv6 private addresses.

private :Private IP Address is used to communicate within the network.
public :Public IP Address is used to communicate outside the network.

10 instance type 
Instance types comprise varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity and give you the 
flexibility to choose the appropriate mix of resources for your applications.
